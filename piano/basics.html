<p>This page is about the Piano Basics and the fingerings and you will see that there will be many more as well as the orders/letters of the keys.</p>

<h1>We have a video from youtube to help you get the gist of the idea.</h1>
<button class="basic-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=827jmswqnEA&t=16s">Click here to go to the first tutorial!</button>
<p>This video listed above teaches you some minor facts and some detailed presentation about the piano tutorial and some factor as well such as fingering.</p>

<h2>Now it's time for some of my worded tutoring.</h2>
<br>
<div class="teaching">
<ul>
<li>The first key on the piano all the way to your left starts at the letter A. </li>
<li>The Piano scale only goes up to G so start couting the letters from A-G from the first key to the key that G ends on.</li>
<li>After you reach the G then repeat starting with the same key that ended with G that you left off on.</li>
<li>Now that you got the lettering right!</li>
<li>Here, I think the chromatic scale on the Piano would really help you in mastering this technique and remembering the keys.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The "Chromatic Scale technique is clicking on A,B,C,D,E,F,G again and again till you reach the last key of the piano which is all the way to the right.</p>
<br>
<p>This is just supposed to be the basics so there are not any other practices written in this page. We might add more practices later.</p>
